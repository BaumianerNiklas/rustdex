# Rustdex

Very simple Rust command line app to query [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co), made to get myself started with Rust.

## Installation

1. Install Rust
2. `cargo install --git https://github.com/BaumianerNiklas/rustdex`

## Usage

```sh
rustdex <pokemon>
```

Where `pokemon` is the (national) dex number or name of a Pokémon.
